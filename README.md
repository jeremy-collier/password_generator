# password_generator
A Random Password Generator.

Gives the option to generate either a 9 or 13 character password with the following rules:
- First letter is always a letter
- Includes lowercase letters
- Includes uppercase letters
- Includes numbers
- Includes special characters


Future Improvements:
- First character is currently always a lowercase. This should be random between lower- and upper-case 
- Add a filter to include/exclude special characters, numbers, uppercase
- Add a third option for password, so there would be normal, secure, very secure
